# Day 04 — SQL Bootcamp

## _Snapshots, virtual tables… What is going on?_

Resume: Today you will see how to use a virtual view and physical snapshot of data.


## Rules of the day

- Please make sure you have your own database and access for it on your PostgreSQL cluster. 
- Please download a [script](materials/model.sql) with Database Model here and apply the script to your database (you can use command line with psql or just run it through any IDE, for example DataGrip from JetBrains or pgAdmin from PostgreSQL community). **Our knowledge way is incremental and linear therefore please be aware all changes that you made in Day03 during exercises 07-13 should be on place (its similar like in real world , when we applied a release and need to be consistency with data for new changes).**
- All tasks contain a list of Allowed and Denied sections with listed database options, database types, SQL constructions etc. Please have a look at this section before you start.
- Please take a look at the Logical View of our Database Model.

1. **pizzeria** table (Dictionary Table with available pizzerias)
- field id — primary key
- field name — name of pizzeria
- field rating — average rating of pizzeria (from 0 to 5 points)
2. **person** table (Dictionary Table with persons who loves pizza)
- field id — primary key
- field name — name of person
- field age — age of person
- field gender — gender of person
- field address — address of person
3. **menu** table (Dictionary Table with available menu and price for concrete pizza)
- field id — primary key
- field pizzeria_id — foreign key to pizzeria
- field pizza_name — name of pizza in pizzeria
- field price — price of concrete pizza
4. **person_visits** table (Operational Table with information about visits of pizzeria)
- field id — primary key
- field person_id — foreign key to person
- field pizzeria_id — foreign key to pizzeria
- field visit_date — date (for example 2022-01-01) of person visit 
5. **person_order** table (Operational Table with information about persons orders)
- field id — primary key
- field person_id — foreign key to person
- field menu_id — foreign key to menu
- field order_date — date (for example 2022-01-01) of person order 

People's visit and people's order are different entities and don't contain any correlation between data. For example, a customer can be in a restaurant (just looking at the menu) and in that time place an order in another restaurant by phone or mobile application. Or another case, just be at home and again make a call with order without any visits.


## Exercise 00 — Let’s create separated views for persons

Write an SQL statement that satisfies the formula `(R - S)∪(S - R)` .
Where R is the `person_visits` table with a filter through January 2, 2022, S is also the `person_visits` table but with a different filter through January 6, 2022. Please do your calculations with sets under the `person_id` column and this column will be alone in a result. Please sort the result by the `person_id` column and present your final SQL in the `v_symmetric_union` (*) database view.

(*) To be honest, the definition of "symmetric union" doesn't exist in set theory. This is the author's interpretation, the main idea is based on the existing rule of symmetric difference.

Please create a Database View `v_price_with_discount` that returns the orders of a person with person name, pizza name, real price and calculated column `discount_price` (with applied 10% discount and satisfying formula `price - price*0.1`). Please sort the result by person names and pizza names and convert the `discount_price` column to integer type. See a sample result below.

Please create a Materialized View `mv_dmitriy_visits_and_eats` (with data included) based on the SQL statement that finds the name of the pizzeria where Dmitriy visited on January 8, 2022 and could eat pizzas for less than 800 rubles (this SQL can be found at Day #02 Exercise #07). 

To check yourself, you can write SQL to the Materialized View `mv_dmitriy_visits_and_eats` and compare the results with your previous query.

Let's refresh the data in our Materialized View `mv_dmitriy_visits_and_eats` from Exercise #06. Before this action, please create another Dmitriy visit that satisfies the SQL clause of the Materialized View except pizzeria, which we can see in a result from Exercise #06.
After adding a new visit, please update a data state for `mv_dmitriy_visits_and_eats`.
